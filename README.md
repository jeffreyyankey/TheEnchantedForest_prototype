# TheEnchantedForest_prototype
Unity FPS prototype written in C#

This is not the complete project but examples of the coding. It is designed for the Unity environment.

The original weapon was a grenade still referenced in code but the weapon is now a shotgun.
The light script is for the "moon" light. When the Necromicon is touched, the white light transitions from white to red. When the final ghost is defeated, the moon transitions back to white.
