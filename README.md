# TheEnchantedForest_prototype
Unity FPS prototype written in C#

This is not the complete project but examples of the coding. It is designed for the Unity environment.

The original weapon was a grenade still referenced in code but the weapon is now a shotgun. The light script is for the "moonlight". When the Necronomicon is touched, the moonlight transitions from white to red. When the final ghost is defeated, the moonlight transitions back to white.
